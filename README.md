# Baseball Simulator

This Python code simulates the offense of a baseball team, so you can compare different lineups and see which scores best.

## How to run
Run the `baseball.py` file.

At the bottom, uncomment either `play_one_game` (to see a game printed out play-by-play) or `play_many_games` (to simulate many).
