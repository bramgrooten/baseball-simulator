# Baseball Simulator

This Python code simulates the offense of a baseball team, so you can compare different lineups and see which scores best.

## How to run
Run the `baseball.py` file.

At the bottom, uncomment either `play_one_game` (to see a game printed out play-by-play) or `play_many_games` (to simulate many).


## Possible improvements:
- make double play prob depend on where runners are on base
- make double play prob depend on which runner it is
- make steal probs depend on which runner it is
- actually, make all probabilities depend on which runner it is
- make prob_advance_runner_on_out depend on where runners are on base
- make histogram of scores when many are played
